abstract = {The temperature distribution throughout arrays of illuminated metal nanoparticles is investigated numerically and experimentally. The two cases of continuous and femtosecond-pulsed illumination are addressed. In the case of continuous illumination, two distinct regimes are evidenced: a temperature confinement regime, where the temperature increase remains confined at the vicinity of each nanosource of heat, and a temperature delocalization regime, where the temperature is uniform throughout the whole nanoparticle assembly despite the heat sources' nanometric size. We show that the occurrence of one regime or another simply depends on the geometry of the nanoparticle distribution. In particular, we derived (i) simple expressions of dimensionless parameters aimed at predicting the degree of temperature confinement and (ii) analytical expressions aimed at estimating the actual temperature increase at the center of an assembly of nanoparticles under illumination, preventing heavy numerical simulations. All these theoretical results are supported by experimental measurements of the temperature distribution on regular arrays of gold nanoparticles under illumination. In the case of femtosecond-pulsed illumination, we explain the two conditions that must be fulfilled to observe a further enhanced temperature spatial confinement.},

abstract = {A broad visible and infrared photoluminescence continuum is detected from surface-plasmon-enhanced transitions in gold nanostructures. We find that the ratio of generated infrared to visible emission is much stronger for gold nanostructures than for smooth gold films. While visible emission is well explained by interband transitions of d-band electrons into the conduction band and subsequent radiative recombination, the strong infrared emission cannot be accounted for by the same mechanism. We propose that the infrared emission is generated by intraband transitions mediated by the strongly confined fields near metal nanostruc- tures ?localized surface plasmons?. These fields possess wave numbers that are comparable to the wave numbers of electrons in the metal, and the associated field gradients give rise to higher-order multipolar transitions.We compare photoluminescence spectra for single gold spheres, smooth and rough gold films, and sharp gold tips and demonstrate that the infrared signal is only present for surfaces with nanometer-scale roughness.},

In this vein, we investigated luminescence from individual gold nanorods and found that their emission characteristics closely resemble surface plasmon behavior. In particular, we observed spectral similarities between the scattering spectra of individual nanorods and their photoluminescence emission. We also measured a blueshift of the photoluminescence peak wavelength with decreasing aspect ratio of the nanorods as well as an optically tunable shape-dependent spectrum of the photoluminescence. The emission yield of single nanorods strongly depends on the orientation of the incident polarization consistent with the properties of surface plasmons.},

The spectra reveal new features which are correlated with interband transitions at selected symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. Calculating luminescence spectra based on simplified models of the band structures of the noble metals and taking into account the Fresnel local-field corrections, we find qualitative agreement with the observed spectra from smooth samples. The agreement between theory and experiment is less satisfactory for rough samples. The influence of surface roughness on the luminescence is largely attributable to local-field enhancement in the rough surface protrusions.},

abstract = {A hyperspectral imaging method was developed that allowed the identification of heterogeneous plasmon response from 50 nm diameter gold colloidal particles on a conducting substrate in a transparent three-electrode spectroelectrochemical cell under non-Faradaic conditions. At cathodic potentials, we identified three distinct behaviors from different nanoparticles within the same sample: irreversible chemical reactions, reversible chemical reactions, and reversible charge density tuning. The irreversible reactions in particular would be difficult to discern in alternate methodologies. Additional heterogeneity was observed when single nanoparticles demonstrating reversible charge density tuning in the cathodic regime were measured dynamically in anodic potential ranges. Some nanoparticles that showed charge density tuning in the cathodic range also showed signs of an additional chemical tuning mechanism in the anodic range. The expected changes in nanoparticle free-electron density were modeled using a charge density-modified Drude dielectric function and Mie theory, a commonly used model in colloidal spectroelectrochemistry. Inconsistencies between experimental results and predictions of this common physical model were identified and highlighted. The broad range of responses on even a simple sample highlights the rich experimental and theoretical playgrounds that hyperspectral single-particle electrochemistry opens.},

Indeed, temperature influences many intracellular processes and is also involved as an activator in novel therapies. Aiming to assist such developments, several approaches have recently been proposed to probe cell temperature in vitro. None of them have so far been extended to a living organism. Here we present the first in vivo intracellular temperature imaging. Our technique relies on measuring the fluorescence polarization anisotropy of green fluorescent protein (GFP) on a set of GFP expressing neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). We demonstrate fast and noninvasive monitoring of subdegree temperature changes on a single neuron induced by local photoheating of gold nanoparticles. This simple and biocompatible technique is envisioned to benefit several fields including hyperthermia treatment, selective drug delivery, thermal regulation of gene expression and neuron laser ablation.},

abstract = {Accurate thermometry at micro- and nanoscales is essential in many nanobiotechnological applications. The nanothermometers introduced in this paper are composed of labeled molecular beacons (MBs) comprising gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on which, depending on application, many MBs of one or more types are immobilized. In this design, three differently labeled MBs with different thermostabilities function as the sensing elements, and AuNPs act as carriers of the MBs and also quenchers of their fluorophores. This flexible design results in a number of nanothermometers with various temperature-sensing ranges. At the lowest temperature, the MBs are in the closed form, where they are quenched. By increasing the temperature, the MBs start to open with respect to their melting points (Tm), and as a result, the fluorescence emission will increase. The temperature resolution of the nanoprobes over a range of 15-60 °C is less than 0.50 °C, which indicates their high sensitivity. Such a good temperature resolution is a result of the specific design of the unusual less stable MBs and also presence of many MBs on AuNPs. The reproducibility and precision of the probes are also satisfactory. The multiplex MB nanoprobe is suitable for thermal imaging by fluorescence microscopy.},

We assign the photoluminescence to the radiative decay of the longitudinal surface plasmon generated after fast interconversion from excited electron-hole pairs that were initially created by 532 nm excitation. The emission intensity was converted to the quantum yield and was found to approximately exponentially decrease as the energy difference between the excitation and emission wavelength increased for gold nanorods with plasmon resonances between 600 and 800 nm.

Light absorbed by gold nanoparticles, for example, is very efficiently converted into heat, and single particles can thus be used as a fine tool to apply heat to a nanoscopic area. At the same time, gold nanoparticles are subject to optical forces when they are irradiated with a focused laser beam, which renders it possible to print, manipulate, and optically trap them in two and three dimensions. Here, we demonstrate how these properties can be used to control the polymerization reaction and thermal curing of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) at the nanoscale and how these findings can be applied to synthesize polymer nanostructures such as particles and nanowires with subdiffraction limited resolution.},

This process becomes strongly enhanced under plasmon resonance and also depends on the shape and organization of the nanoparticles. In particular, the amount of generated heat and temperature increase depends on the number of nanoparticles in a complex. Metal nanoparticles may induce phase transformations when they are in thermal contact with a polymer or a solid matrix, such as ice.

abstract = {We present an overview of the feasibility of using coherent phonon spectroscopy to study interaction dynamics of excited lattice vibrations with their environments. By exploiting the features of coherent phonons with a pump-probe technique, one can study lattice motions in a sub-picosecond time range. The dephasing properties tell us not only about interaction dynamics with carriers (electrons and holes) or thermal phonons but also about point defects in crystals. Modulations of the coherent phonon amplitude by more than two modes are closely related to phonon-carrier or phonon-phonon interferences. Related to this phenomenon, formation of coherent phonons at higher harmonics gives direct evidence for phonon-phonon couplings. A combined study of coherent phonons and ultrafast carrier response can be useful for understanding phonon-carrier interaction dynamics. For metals like zinc, nonequilibrium electrons may dominate the dynamics of both relaxation and generation of coherent phonons. The frequency chirp of coherent phonons can be a direct measure of how and when phonon-phonon and phonon-carrier couplings occur. Carbon nanotubes show some complicated behavior due to the existence of many modes with different symmetries, resulting in superposition or interference. To illustrate one of the most interesting applications, the selective excitation of specific phonon modes through the use of a pulse train technique is shown.},

abstract = {Metal nanoshells are a class of nanoparticles with tunable optical resonances. In this article, an application of this technology to thermal ablative therapy for cancer is described. By tuning the nanoshells to strongly absorb light in the near infrared, where optical transmission through tissue is optimal, a distribution of nanoshells at depth in tissue can be used to deliver a therapeutic dose of heat by using moderately low exposures of extracorporeally applied near-infrared (NIR) light. Human breast carcinoma cells incubated with nanoshells in vitro were found to have undergone photothermally induced morbidity on exposure to NIR light (820 nm, 35 W/cm2), as determined by using a fluorescent viability stain. Cells without nanoshells displayed no loss in viability after the same periods and conditions of NIR illumination. Likewise, in vivo studies under magnetic resonance guidance revealed that exposure to low doses of NIR light (820 nm, 4 W/cm2) in solid tumors treated with metal nanoshells reached average maximum temperatures capable of inducing irreversible tissue damage (DeltaT = 37.4 +/- 6.6 degrees C) within 4-6 min. Controls treated without nanoshells demonstrated significantly lower average temperatures on exposure to NIR light (DeltaT {\textless} 10 degrees C). These findings demonstrated good correlation with histological findings. Tissues heated above the thermal damage threshold displayed coagulation, cell shrinkage, and loss of nuclear staining, which are indicators of irreversible thermal damage. Control tissues appeared undamaged.},

Bubble formation is explosive even under continuous-wave heating. The fast, inertia-governed expansion is followed by a slower contraction and disappearance after some tens of nanoseconds. In a narrow range of illumination powers, bubble time traces show a clear echo signature. We attribute it to sound waves released upon the initial explosion and reflected by flat interfaces, hundreds of microns away from the particle. Echoes can trigger new explosions. A nanobubble's steady state (with a vapor shell surrounding the heated nanoparticle) can be reached by a proper time profile of the heating intensity. Stable nanobubbles could have original applications for light modulation and for enhanced optical–acoustic coupling in photoacoustic microscopy.},

We identify the role of plasmons in photoluminescence as modulating the energy transfer between excited electrons and emitted photons. By comparing photoluminescence spectra with scattering spectra, we observed that the photoluminescence of individual gold nanostructures showed the same dependencies on shape, size, and plasmon coupling as the particle plasmon resonances. Our results provide conclusive evidence that the photoluminescence in gold nanostructures indeed occurs via radiative damping of plasmon resonances driven by excited electrons in the metal itself. Moreover, we provide new insight on the underlying mechanism based on our analysis of a reproducible blue shift of the photoluminescence peak (relative to the scattering peak) and observation of an incomplete depolarization of the photoluminescence.},

abstract = {This article provides a review of our recent Rayleigh scattering measurements on single metal nanoparticles. Two different systems will be discussed in detail: gold nanorods with lengths between 30 and 80 nm, and widths between 8 and 30 nm; and hollow gold-silver nanocubes (termed nanoboxes or nanocages depending on their exact morphology) with edge lengths between 100 and 160 nm, and wall thicknesses of the order of 10 nm. The goal of this work is to understand how the linewidth of the localized surface plasmon resonance depends on the size, shape, and environment of the nanoparticles. Specifically, the relative contributions from bulk dephasing, electron-surface scattering, and radiation damping (energy loss via coupling to the radiation field) have been determined by examining particles with different dimensions. This separation is possible because the magnitude of the radiation damping effect is proportional to the particle volume, whereas, the electron-surface scattering contribution is inversely proportional to the dimensions. For the nanorods, radiation damping is the dominant effect for thick rods (widths greater than 20 nm), while electron-surface scattering is dominant for thin rods (widths less than 10 nm). Rods with widths in between these limits have narrow resonances-approaching the value determined by the bulk contribution. For nanoboxes and nanocages, both radiation damping and electron-surface scattering are significant at all sizes. This is because these materials have thin walls, but large edge lengths and, therefore, relatively large volumes. The effect of the environment on the localized surface plasmon resonance has also been studied for nanoboxes. Increasing the dielectric constant of the surroundings causes a red-shift and an increase in the linewidth of the plasmon band. The increase in linewidth is attributed to enhanced radiation damping.},

abstract = {Plasmonic nanostructures are of great current interest as chemical sensors, in vivo imaging agents, and for photothermal therapeutics. We study continuous-wave (cw) and pulsed-laser excitation of aqueous suspensions of Au nanorods as a model system for secondary light emission from plasmonic nanostructures. Resonant secondary emission contributes significantly to the background commonly observed in surface-enhanced Raman scattering and to the light emission generated by pulsed-laser excitation of metallic nanostructures that is often attributed to two-photon luminescence. Spectra collected using cw laser excitation at 488 nm show an enhancement of the broad spectrum of emission at the electromagnetic plasmon resonance of the nanorods. The intensity of anti-Stokes emission collected using cw laser excitation at 785 nm is described by a 300 K thermal distribution of excitations. Excitation by subpicosecond laser pulses at 785 nm broadens and increases the intensity of the anti-Stokes emission in a manner that is consistent with electronic Raman scattering by a high-temperature distribution of electronic excitations predicted by a two-temperature model. Broadening of the pulse duration using an etalon reduces the intensity of anti-Stokes emission in quantitative agreement with the model. Experiments using a pair of subpicosecond optical pulses separated by a variable delay show that the timescale of resonant secondary emission is comparable to the timescale for equilibration of electrons and phonons.},

abstract = {Due to strong electric fields at the surface, the absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by noble metal nanoparticles are strongly enhanced. These unique properties provide the potential of designing novel optically active reagents for simultaneous molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. It is desirable to use agents that are active in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the radiation spectrum to minimize the light extinction by intrinsic chromophores in native tissue. Gold nanorods with suitable aspect ratios (length divided by width) can absorb and scatter strongly in the NIR region (650-900 nm). In the present work, we provide an in vitro demonstration of gold nanorods as novel contrast agents for both molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. Nanorods are synthesized and conjugated to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) monoclonal antibodies and incubated in cell cultures with a nonmalignant epithelial cell line (HaCat) and two malignant oral epithelial cell lines (HOC 313 clone 8 and HSC 3). The anti-EGFR anti body-conjugated nanorods bind specifically to the surface of the malignant-type cells with a much higher affinity due to the overexpressed EGFR on the cytoplasmic membrane of the malignant cells. As a result of the strongly scattered red light from gold nanorods in dark field, observed using a laboratory microscope, the malignant cells are clearly visualized and diagnosed from the nonmalignant cells. It is found that, after exposure to continuous red laser at 800 nm, malignant cells require about half the laser energy to be photothermally destroyed than the nonmalignant cells. Thus, both efficient cancer cell diagnostics and selective photothermal therapy are realized at the same time.},

However, recent advances in the field of nanoscience have seen the emergence of noble metal nanostructures with unique photophysical properties, well suited for applications in cancer phototherapy. Noble metal nanoparticles, on account of the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance, possess strongly enhanced visible and near-infrared light absorption, several orders of magnitude more intense compared to conventional laser phototherapy agents. The use of plasmonic nanoparticles as highly enhanced photoabsorbing agents has thus introduced a much more selective and efficient cancer therapy strategy, viz. plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT). The synthetic tunability of the optothermal properties and the bio-targeting abilities of the plasmonic gold nanostructures make the PPTT method furthermore promising. In this review, we discuss the development of the PPTT method with special emphasis on the recent in vitro and in vivo success using gold nanospheres coupled with visible lasers and gold nanorods and silica-gold nanoshells coupled with near-infrared lasers.},

We synthesized gold nanoparticles with diameters of 2, 6, 10, and 16 nm and compared their intracellular distribution in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm (2 and 6 nm) could enter the nucleus, whereas larger ones (10 and 16 nm) were found only in the cytoplasm. We then investigated the possibility of using ultrasmall 2 nm nanoparticles as carriers for nuclear delivery of a triplex-forming oligonucleotide (TFO) that binds to the c-myc promoter. Compared to free TFO, the nanoparticle-conjugated TFO was more effective at reducing c-myc RNA and c-myc protein, which resulted in reduced cell viability. Our result demonstrated that the entry of gold nanoparticles into the cell nucleus is critically dependent on the size of the nanoparticles. We developed a strategy for regulating gene expression, by directly delivering TFOs into the nucleus using ultrasmall gold nanoparticles. More importantly, guidelines were provided to choose appropriate nanocarriers for different biomedical purposes.},

By creating samples with different densities of GNRs on silicon wafer substrates, we were able to determine surface coverage by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and then correlate the coverage to the CAS intensities of the samples. The observed CAS signal intensity was quadratically dependent on the number of particles. We also examined the CAS signal as a function of the excitation polarization and found that the strongest signals in regularly oriented GNRs were observed when the beam polarization was aligned with the longitudinal axis of the GNRs. Irregularly oriented GNRs exhibited a different scattering pattern to that observed for regularly oriented GNRs. The polarization-dependent scattering from oriented GNRs showed cos(6)($\theta$) behavior. By imaging nanoscale-sized GNR patterns using CAS and evaluating the results with SEM, we show that CAS can be used for efficient, label-free imaging of nanoscale metallic particles.},

abstract = {Drug delivery systems (DDSs) offer efficient and localized drug transportation as well as reduce associated side effects. In order to better understand DDSs, precise observation of drug release and delivery is required. Here, we present a strategy, plasmonic-tunable Raman/fluorescence imaging spectroscopy, to track the release and delivery of an anticancer drug (doxorubicin) from gold nanoparticle carriers in real time at a single living cell level. A pH-responsive drug release profile was attained through the conjugation of doxorubicin (DOX) to the nanoparticle surface via a pH-sensitive hydrazone linkage. When DOX is bound to the surface of the gold nanoparticle, its surface-enhanced Raman spectrum can be seen, but its fluorescence is quenched. When released, due to the lysosomes' acidic pH, its Raman enhancement is greatly reduced, changing the acquired Raman spectrum and in turn allowing for the visualization of its fluorescence signal. The plasmonic-tunable Raman/fluorescence properties enabled the tracking of the DOX release and delivery process from the gold nanoparticle surface to the lysosomes of single living cells under the acidic pH change of their microenvironments. This technique offers great potential to follow the molecular mechanisms of drug delivery and release in living cells, as well as the cellular response to drug action.},

This study investigated the feasibility of photothermal ablation therapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma using chitosan-coated gold/gold sulfide (CS-GGS) nanoparticles. A rat esophagoduodenal anastomosis model was used for the in vivo ablation study, and three human esophageal cell lines were used to study the response of cancer cells and benign cells to near infrared light after treatment with CS-GGS. The results indicate that both cancerous tissue and cancer cells took up more gold nanoparticles and were completely ablated after exposure to near infrared light. The benign tissue and noncancerous cells showed less uptake of these nanoparticles, and remained viable after exposure to near infrared light. CS-GGS nanoparticles could provide an optimal endoluminal therapeutic option for near infrared light ablation of esophageal cancer.},

abstract = {The dependence of the strength of the electron-phonon coupling and the electron heat capacity on the electron temperature is investigated for eight representative metals, Al, Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pt, W, and Ti, for the conditions of strong electron-phonon nonequilibrium. These conditions are characteristic of metal targets subjected to energetic ion bombardment or short-pulse laser irradiation. Computational analysis based on first-principles electronic structure calculations of the electron density of states predicts large deviations (up to an order of magnitude) from the commonly used approximations of linear temperature dependence of the electron heat capacity and a constant electron-phonon coupling. These thermophysical properties are found to be very sensitive to details of the electronic structure of the material. The strength of the electron-phonon coupling can either increase (Al, Au, Ag, Cu, and W), decrease (Ni and Pt), or exhibit nonmonotonic changes (Ti) with increasing electron temperature. The electron heat capacity can exhibit either positive (Au, Ag, Cu, and W) or negative (Ni and Pt) deviations from the linear temperature dependence. The large variations of the thermophysical properties, revealed in this work for the range of electron temperatures typically realized in femtosecond laser material processing applications, have important implications for quantitative computational analysis of ultrafast processes associated with laser interaction with metals.},

Partially for these reasons, colloidal solutions of metallic (especially silver and gold) nanoparticles have long fascinated scientists because of their very intense colours. The intense red colour of colloidal gold nanoparticles is due to their surface plasmon absorption. This article describes the physical origin of the surface plasmon absorption in gold nanoparticles with emphasis on the Mie and also the Maxwell-Garnett theory and reviews the effects of particle size and shape on the resonance condition.

We assign this emission to the electron and hole interband recombination. The increase in the emission yield results from the enhancement effect of the incoming and outgoing electric fields via coupling to the surface plasmon resonance in the rods.

abstract = {Tailoring the longitudinal surface plasmon wavelengths (LSPWs), scattering, and absorption cross sections of gold nanorods has been demonstrated by combining anisotropic shortening and transverse overgrowth and judiciously choosing starting Au nanorods. Shortening yields Au nanorods with decreasing lengths but a fixed diameter, while overgrowth produces nanorods with increasing diameters but a nearly unchanged length. Two series of Au nanorods with LSPWs varying in the same spectral range but distinct extinction coefficients are thus obtained. The systematic changes in the LSPW and extinction for the two series of Au nanorods are found to be in good agreement with those obtained from Gans theory. Dark-field imaging performed on two representative nanorod samples with similar LSPWs shows that the scattering intensities of the overgrown nanorods are much larger than those of the shortened nanorods. The experimental results are found to be in very good agreement with those obtained from finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations. FDTD calculations further reveal that the scattering-to-extinction ratio increases linearly as a function of the diameter for Au nanorods with a fixed aspect ratio.},

Tumors were grown in immune-competent mice by subcutaneous injection of murine colon carcinoma cells (CT26.WT). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated nanoshells (???130 nm diameter) with peak optical absorption in the NIR were intravenously injected and allowed to circulate for 6 h.

Heat generation can be beneficial or detrimental for a given system or technique, but in either case it is useful to have knowledge of local temperatures. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), potentially down to the limit of single-molecule (SM) detection, has been suggested as a viable route for measuring nanoscale temperatures through simultaneous collection of Stokes and anti-Stokes SER scattering, as the ratio of their intensities is related to the Boltzmann distribution.

We find a drastic reduction of the plasmon dephasing rate in nanorods as compared to small nanospheres due to a suppression of interband damping. The rods studied here also show very little radiation damping, due to their small volumes. These findings imply large local-field enhancement factors and relatively high light-scattering efficiencies, making metal nanorods extremely interesting for optical applications. Comparison with theory shows that pure dephasing and interface damping give negligible contributions to the total plasmon dephasing rate.},

abstract = {Femtosecond electron thermalization in metals was investigated using transient thermomodulation transmissivity and reflectivity. Studies were performed using a tunable multiple-wavelength femtosecond pump-probe technique in optically thin gold films in the low perturbation limit. An IR pump beam is used to heat the electron distribution and changes in electron temperature are measured with a visible probe beam at the d band to Fermi-surface transition. We show that the subpicosecond optical response of gold is dominated by delayed thermalization of the electron gas. This effect is particularly important far off the spectral peak of the reflectivity or transmissivity changes, permitting a direct and sensitive access to the internal thermalization of the electron gas. Using a simple rate-equation model, line-shape analysis of the transient reflectivity and transmissivity indicates a thermalization time of the order of 500 fs. At energies close to the Fermi surface, longer thermalization times ∼1–2 ps are observed. These results are in agreement with a more sophisticated model based on calculations of the electron-thermalization dynamics by numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation. This model quantitatively describes the measured transient optical response during the full thermalization time of electron gas, of the order of 1.5 ps, and gives new insight into electron thermalization in metals.},

In this paper, we devise a novel nanothermometer, capable of accurately determining the temperature of solutions as well as biological systems such as HeLa cancer cells. The nanothermometer is based on the temperature-sensitive fluorescence of NaYF(4):Er(3+),Yb(3+) nanoparticles, where the intensity ratio of the green fluorescence bands of the Er(3+) dopant ions ((2)H(11/2) --{\textgreater} (4)I(15/2) and (4)S(3/2) --{\textgreater} (4)I(15/2)) changes with temperature. The nanothermometers were first used to obtain thermal profiles created when heating a colloidal solution of NaYF(4):Er(3+),Yb(3+) nanoparticles in water using a pump-probe experiment. Following incubation of the nanoparticles with HeLa cervical cancer cells and their subsequent uptake, the fluorescent nanothermometers measured the internal temperature of the living cell from 25 degrees C to its thermally induced death at 45 degrees C.},

Compared to gold nanospheres, we observe an increase of QY by about an order of magnitude for particles with a plasmon resonance {\textgreater}650 nm. The observed trend in QY is further confirmed by controlled reshaping of a single gold nanorod to a spherelike shape. Moreover, we identify two spectral components, one around 500 nm originating from a combination of interband transitions and the transverse plasmon and one coinciding with the longitudinal plasmon band. These components are analyzed by correlating scattering and luminescence spectra of single nanorods and performing polarization sensitive measurements. Our study contributes to the understanding of luminescence from gold nanorods. The enhanced QY we report can benefit applications in biological and soft matter studies.},

Besides standard sequential execution, ADDA can run on a multiprocessor distributed-memory system, parallelizing a single DDA calculation. Hence the size parameter of the scatterer is in principle limited only by total available memory and computational speed. ADDA is written in C99 and is highly portable. It provides full control over the scattering geometry (particle morphology and orientation, and incident beam) and allows one to calculate a wide variety of integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities (cross sections, the Mueller matrix, etc.). Moreover, ADDA incorporates a range of state-of-the-art DDA improvements, aimed at increasing the accuracy and computational speed of the method. We discuss both physical and computational aspects of the DDA simulations and provide a practical introduction into performing such simulations with the ADDA code. We also present several simulation results, in particular, for a sphere with size parameter 320 (100-wavelength diameter) and refractive index 1.05.},

The resonant LSPR mode frequencies of the nanorods were determined from interferometrically detected TPPL signals. For these measurements, the interpulse time delays of a spectrally broad laser pulse (1.48?1.65 eV) were changed systematically with attosecond time resolution, and the TPPL signal amplitude was recorded.

These results showed that the dephasing time increased from 22 ± 4 to 31 ± 9 fs as the LSPR resonance energy decreased from 1.76 to 1.53 eV, as a result of less efficient plasmon dephasing due to interband scattering for lower energy resonances.

abstract = {Plasmon enhancement of optical properties is both fundamentally important and appealing for many biological and photonic applications. Although metal-enhanced two-photon excitation fluorescence has been demonstrated in the solid substrates, there is no report on metal enhanced overall two-photon excitation fluorescence in the colloid system. Here we systematically investigated gold nanorod enhanced one- and two-photon excitation fluorescence of a porphyrin molecule, T790. The separation distance between the metal core and T790 was varied by adjusting the silica shell thickness from 13 to 42 nm. One- and two-photon excitation fluorescence intensities of T790 were found to strongly depend on the thickness of silica shell that separates gold nanorod and T790. The optimum one- and two-photon excitation fluorescence enhancement was found to occur at shell thicknesses of 34 and 20 nm, with enhancement factors of 2.1 and 11.8, respectively. Fluorescence lifetime of T790 steadily decreased as the shell thickness decreased. The observed two-photon excitation fluorescence enhancement is ascribed to a combination effect of local electric field amplification and competition between increased radiative and non-radiative decay rates. Core-shell nanoparticles that displayed enhanced two-photon excitation fluorescence were also found to exhibit significantly improved singlet oxygen generation capability under two-photon excitation. The applications of these nanoparticles as effective agents for two-photon cell imaging and nano-photosensitizers for two-photon photodynamic therapy with improved efficiency have also been demonstrated in HepG2 cancer cells. The combined advantages of enhanced two-photon excitation fluorescence and two-photon induced singlet oxygen generation make these core-shell nanoparticles as attractive agents for two-photon imaging guided two-photon photodynamic therapy.},
