% \section{Determination of the error in the temperature
% extraction}\label{sec:discussion_errors} Together with the excitation intensity,
% the plasmon position has a crucial role in the accuracy of the extracted temperature. The luminescence spectrum acquired
% with the $532\nm$ laser shows an asymmetric shape, due to a broadband
% contribution from gold added to the plasmonic emission. This makes the initial
% fitting needed for the SPR function of equation \ref{eqn:fitting} non univocally
% determined. For the particle shown in Fig. \ref{fig:spectra_rod}, changing the
% initial wavelength of the fit from $600\nm$ to $640\nm$ yields a significative
% difference in the obtained parameters of the lorentzian.
%

% \caption{Estimation of the error due to different fitting parameters of the
% plasmon spectrum. a) 2D grid of the difference in temperature obtained while

% while keeping either $P_2$ or $P_3$ constant.}
% 	\label{fig:estimation-error}
% \end{figure}
% 
% Using the following expression for the $I_\textrm{SPR}$ function in $\eV$, 
% \begin{equation*}
% I_\textrm{SPR}(E) = \frac{P_1}{(E-P_2)^2+P_3}
% \end{equation*}
% The different fitting ranges give values for $P_2$ between $1.940\eV$ and
% $1.955eV$, while the values of $P_3$ lie in between $5\cdot10^{-3}\eV^2$ and
% $8\cdot10^{-3}\eV^2$. Figure \ref{fig:estimation-error}.a shows the extracted
% temperature difference from the anti-Stokes spectra for all the possible
% parameter combinations in the range just mentioned. Figure \ref{fig:estimation-error}.b
% shows the temperature dependence while keeping either $P_2$ or $P_3$ constant.
% 
% In this example it is possible to note that the extracted temperature is highly
% dependent on the fitted width of the plasmon spectrum but barely dependent on
% the extracted peak position. From the initial spectrum of the particle, it is
% possible to note that the wing of the plasmon coincides with the range of
% anti-Stokes emission. Therefore minute changes in the initial shape will yield
% higher changes in the extracted temperature.
% 
% This assertion implies that there should be particles in which the extracted
% temperature wouldn't be too sensitive to the initial plasmon fit. To explore
% these possibilities, we calculated the anti-Stokes emission of different
% particles at $400\K$ by using equation \ref{eqn:fitting} and the results of ADDA
% calculations for the SPR function. We then extracted a temperature from these
% spectra while varying the lorentzian parameters as was done for the experimental
% results. In this way it is possible to study the expected error in temperature
% generated by the initial uncertainty in the fitting of the plasmon for different
% particles.

% \caption{Calculated error in the temperature extraction due to the uncertainty
% in the plasmon parameters as a function of the resonance position of the
% particle. Clearly, when exciting at the blue wing of the plasmon, the effect of
% these uncertainties is much lower.}
% 	\label{fig:calculated-error}
% \end{figure}
% 
% Figure \ref{fig:calculated-error} shows the uncertainty in the extracted
% temperature as a function of the plasmon peak position. The uncertainty is
% defined as the difference of the maximum and the minimum extracted temperatures
% while varying $P_2$ by $10\%$ and $P_3$ by $30\%$. The vertical red line depicts
% the position of the laser. It is remarkable the difference for particles with a
% resonance red-shifted from the excitation laser to particles blue-shifted.
% Indeed, when the plasmon favors the anti-Stokes emission the correct modelling
% of the resonance is crucial for the extraction of temperatures. On the other
% hand, when the plasmon is red-shifted from the excitation, the induced error in
% the extracted temperature is much lower. The amount of collected light is
% another factor to keep into account. When the resonance is red-shifted
% from the laser, the anti-Stokes emission is much weaker and therefore
% accumulating enough photons in the spectrometer requires longer acquisition
% times.
\section{Experimental setup}\label{sec:setup}




\section{Gold Nanorod temperature calculations} \label{sec:temp-calc}

\begin{figure}[htp] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/Supplementary/03_Compare_Comsol/03_Compare_Comsol.png}
\caption{Calculated temperature for a $21\nm\times 50\nm$ nanorod under
different excitation intensities. The full line is the result of the simple
model while the dots are the calculated values using Comsol. The circles are
with the default heat conductivity and the diamonds are with a constant value.}
	\label{fig:Compare-Comsol}
\end{figure}

Throughout the main text the temperature measured with the anti-Stokes emission
is compared to the calculated temperature using a simple heat diffusion
equation. For spheres, assuming a thermal conductivity much higher than the
surrounding medium, the temperature increase is given by

\begin{equation}
	\Delta \textrm{T}(P) = \frac{P}{4\pi k_{\textrm{water}} R}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $P$ is the dissipated power, $k_{\textrm{water}}$ is the heat
conductivity of water and $R$ is the radius of the particle. The dissipated power can be
easily derived from the cross section of the particle at a given wavelength and
the intensity of the focused laser beam. For nanorods we assumed an
equivalent radius such that the total area is preserved.

Figure \ref{fig:Compare-Comsol} shows the difference between the results from
the equation (full line) and a finite element method calculation using Comsol
(dots) for a nanorod of length $50\nm$ and diameter $21\nm$. The cross section
and dissipated power were kept the same. The blue circles are the results given
by using the built-in material properties of water, i.e. a thermal conductivity
that depends on temperature. The diamonds are the results when the thermal
conductivity is fixed to $0.61 \W(\m\cdot\K)^{-1}$. The difference is
accentuated at higher temperatures.

\section{Luminescence power dependence}
\begin{figure}[htp] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/Supplementary/01_AS_S_in_Log/01_AS_S_in_Log.png}
\caption{Stokes and anti-Stokes emission as a function of excitation power. The
linear fit in logarithmic scale has a slope of $0.88$ and $1.20$ respectively,
ensuring the 1-photon nature of both kinds of emission.}
	\label{fig:Log_Plot}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Log_Plot} shows the intensity of the Stokes (red) and
anti-Stokes (blue) emission for several excitation powers. In both cases the
linear fit in logarithmic scale has a slope close to $1$, being $0.88$ for the
Stokes and $1.20$ for the anti-Stokes, confirming that both types of emission
are single-photon processes. The behavior is independent of the plasmon
resonance position. It is important to note that the excitation intensity cannot
be increased much beyond what is shown because nanorods would start reshaping
towards a more spherical shape at higher laser powers.

\section{Anti-stokes luminescence form nanospheres}

 %\begin{figure}[tp] \centering
 %\includegraphics[width=80mm]{Figures/04_Extracted_Temp/04_extracted_temp.png}
 %\caption{Temperature of a single nanorod under the same $633\nm$
 %excitation conditions, but at different medium temperatures. }
 	%\label{fig:AS-temps-rods}
 %\end{figure}
 %
 %It is also possible to keep the excitation intensity constant and to vary the
 %temperature of the surrounding medium. Figure \ref{fig:AS-temps-rods} shows the
 %extracted temperature from the fitting with equation \ref{eqn:fitting} as a
 %function of the temperature of the medium. The red line is showing the water
 %temperature and acts as a guide to the eye. The Figure clearly shows an increase
 %in the extracted temperature while increasing the temperature of the flow cell.
 %The range of explored temperatures was from $296\K$ to $320\K$. This range is
 %enough to observe a change in the anti-Stokes emission spectrum. At higher
 %temperatures the stability of the setup plays a crucial role in maintaining the
 %particle in focus during the spectra acquisition time. Longer exposure times and
 %therefore lower excitation intensities can be employed if particles are actively
 %maintained in focus.
 
 Particles that can withstand higher excitation powers and that have a
 well-defined plasmon resonance are of great interest, because they would allow
 to employ a single wavelength and also to reduce the exposure times to record
 the spectra. A well defined plasmon resonance also lowers the uncertainties
 associated with the initial lorentzian fit needed for the term $I_\textrm{SPR}$
 in equation \ref{eqn:fitting}. In principle gold nanospheres fulfill these
 requirements. They are known to withstand much higher excitation powers without
 reshaping nor melting\cite{Hou2015}. Moreover the plasmon resonance of spheres
 shifts only slightly with radius, therefore it is possible to predict it using
 Mie theory and to eliminate the need of a second laser beam. Sphere samples
 however always show a shape distribution that cannot be neglected\cite{Lee2013}
 and that induces deviations of the observed resonance from Mie's model.
 
 \begin{figure}[tp] \centering
 \includegraphics[width=85.2mm]{Figures/07_Spheres/07_spheres.png}
 \caption{Normalized luminescence spectra of spheres with diameters of $60\nm$,
 $40\nm$ and $30\nm$ under $532\nm$ excitation. The inset shows the detail of the anti-Stokes emission without normalization.
 The excitation powers for the three particles were $1.2\mW$, $2.0\mW$ and
 $3.6\mW$ respectively.}
 	\label{fig:spheres}
 \end{figure}
 
 Figure \ref{fig:spheres} shows the normalized luminescence spectra of three
 nanospheres of diameters $60\nm$, $40\nm$ and $30\nm$ under $532\nm$ excitation.
 As for the nanorods, two very distinctive parts of the spectrum are
 distinguishable, the Stokes spectrum at longer wavelengths and the anti-Stokes
 spectrum at shorter ones. From Mie theory we would have expected a blue
 shift of the resonance with decreasing radius of the particles; however the
 $30\nm$ sphere seems to be the most red-shifted. This is most likely due to small anisotropies of the
 particles, giving rise to slightly different plasmon resonances. The inset in
 Fig.\ref{fig:spheres} shows a detail of the anti-Stokes emission for the three
 spheres without any further normalization. It has to be pointed out, however,
 that the excitation intensities were $1.2\mW$, $2.0\mW$ and $3.6\mW$ to
 compensate for the lower cross sections of the smaller particles.
 
 Spheres not only have a smaller cross section than nanorods of the same volume,
 but their quantum yield is also one order of magnitude lower than that of
 rods\cite{Yorulmaz2012}. The weaker emission from these particles can be
 compensated by increasing the excitation power. The maximum power that can be
 employed is given by either reaching the melting temperature of gold or by
 inducing a phase transition of the surrounding liquid. The first would induce an
 irreversible change in shape of the particles\cite{Zijlstra2009a} the latter
 would induce a change in the refractive index of the medium and therefore would
 induce a shift in the plasmon resonance\cite{Hou2015}.
 
 \begin{figure}[tp] \centering
 \includegraphics[width=82.7mm]{Figures/07_Spheres/07_spheres_02.png}
 \caption{Extracted temperature from the same particles as in fig.
 \ref{fig:spheres} at different medium temperatures. }
 	\label{fig:spheres_temp}
 \end{figure}
 
 Figure \ref{fig:spheres_temp} shows the extracted temperature of the three
 particles while increasing the medium temperature. It is possible to see that
 the small $30\nm$ diameter sphere is $150\K$ hotter than both the $40\nm$ and
 $60\nm$. The three curves show an increasing trend, but in this case the
 variation of medium temperature amounts to less than $5\%$ the temperature of
 the particles. The extracted temperature is several tens of degrees above what
 would be expected from the heat equation, considering the absorption cross
 section given by Mie theory. The reason for the discrepancies between the
 measured values and the expected values can be accounted for by the computation
 of the plasmon resonance term $I_\textrm{SPR}$ in eqn. \ref{eqn:fitting}.
 
 As explained earlier for nanorods, the fitting of the anti-Stokes emission is
 highly sensitive to the plasmon position relative to the laser employed. In the
 case of nanospheres, the resonance is slightly shifted to the red from the
 $532\nm$ laser. Small errors in the determination of the plasmon resonance will
 generate larger errors in the temperature extracted. The differences between the
 plasmon observed in fig. \ref{fig:spheres} and the results of Mie scattering
 calculations most likely are due to particles that are not spherical. If this
 was the case, the calculated cross section and plasmon resonance will not
 coincide with the particles under study, leading to larger errors.
 
 The use of spheres would be beneficial for some applications that require higher
 excitation powers or smaller particles. The intrinsic heterogeneity of the
 samples, however, prevents the use of a single wavelength for the measurements.
 Ideally, white light scattering of single gold nanospheres would provide the
 information on the plasmon resonance needed for the correct fitting of the
 anti-Stokes emission.
