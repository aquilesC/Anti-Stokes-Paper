\section{Determination of the error in the temperature extraction}
Together with the excitation intensity, the plasmon position has a crucial role
in the accuracy of the extracted temperature. The luminescence spectrum acquired
with the $532\nm$ laser shows an asymmetric shape, due to a broadband
contribution from gold added to the plasmonic emission. This makes the initial
fitting needed for the SPR function of equation \ref{eqn:fitting} non univocally
determined. For the particle shown in Fig. \ref{fig:spectra_rod}, changing the
initial wavelength of the fit from $600\nm$ to $640\nm$ yields a significative
difference in the obtained parameters of the lorentzian.

varying both $P_2$ and $P_3$ parameters of the fit. b) Temperature dependence

\end{figure}

Using the following expression for the SPR function in $\eV$, 
\begin{equation*}
\textrm{SPR}(E) = \frac{P_1}{(E-P_2)^2+P_3}
\end{equation*}
The different fitting ranges give values for $P_2$ between $1.940\eV$ and
$1.955eV$, while the values of $P_3$ lie in between $5\cdot10^{-3}\eV^2$ and
$8\cdot10^{-3}\eV^2$. Figure \ref{fig:estimation-error}.a shows the extracted
temperature difference from the anti-Stokes spectra for all the possible
parameter combinations in the range just mentioned. Figure \ref{fig:estimation-error}.b
shows the temperature dependence while keeping either $P_2$ or $P_3$ constant.

In this example it is possible to note that the extracted temperature is highly
dependent on the fitted width of the plasmon spectrum but barely dependent on
the extracted peak position. From the initial spectrum of the particle, it is
possible to note that the wing of the plasmon coincides with the range of
anti-Stokes emission. Therefore minute changes in the initial shape will yield
higher changes in the extracted temperature.

This assertion implies that there should be particles in which the extracted
temperature wouldn't be too sensitive to the initial plasmon fit. To explore
these possibilities, we calculated the anti-Stokes emission of different
particles at $400\K$ by using equation \ref{eqn:fitting} and the results of ADDA
calculations for the SPR function. We then extracted a temperature from these
spectra while varying the lorentzian parameters as was done for the experimental
results. In this way it is possible to study the expected error in temperature
generated by the initial uncertainty in the fitting of the plasmon for different
particles. 

\begin{figure}[htp] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/06_Calculation_error/06_calculation_error.png}
\caption{Calculated error in the temperature extraction due to the uncertainty
in the plasmon parameters as a function of the resonance position of the
particle. Clearly, when exciting at the blue wing of the plasmon, the effect of
these uncertainties is much lower.}
	\label{fig:calculated-error}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:calculated-error} shows the uncertainty in the extracted
temperature as a function of the plasmon peak position. The uncertainty is
defined as the difference of the maximum and the minimum extracted temperatures
while varying $P_2$ by $10\%$ and $P_3$ by $30\%$. The vertical red line depicts
the position of the laser. It is remarkable the difference for particles with a
resonance red-shifted from the excitation laser to particles blue-shifted.
Indeed, when the plasmon favors the anti-Stokes emission the correct modelling
of the resonance is crucial for the extraction of temperatures. On the other
hand, when the plasmon is red-shifted from the excitation, the induced error in
the extracted temperature is much lower. The amount of collected light is
another factor to keep into account. When the resonance is red-shifted
from the laser, the anti-Stokes emission is much weaker and therefore
accumulating enough photons in the spectrometers requires longer acquisition
times.

\section{Comparing Comsol and Simple approximation for temperature calculation}
\begin{figure}[htp] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/Supporting/03_Compare_Comsol/03_Compare_Comsol.png}
\caption{Calculated temperature for a $21\nm\times 50\nm$ nanorod under
different excitation intensities. The full line is the result of the simple
model while the dots are the calculated values using Comsol.}
	\label{fig:Compare-Comsol}
\end{figure}

Throughout the main text the temperature measured with the anti-Stokes emission
is compared to the calculated temperature using a simple heat diffusion
equation. For spheres, assuming a thermal conductivity much higher than the
surrounding medium, the temperature increase is given by

\begin{equation}
	\Delta \textrm{T}(P) = \frac{P}{4\pi k_{\textrm{water}} R}
\end{equation}

Where $P$ is the dissipated power, $k_{\textrm{water}}$ is the heat conductivity
of water and $R$ is the radius of the particle. The dissipated power can be
easily derived from the cross section of the particle at a given wavelength and
the power density of the focused laser beam. For nanorods we assumed an
equivalent radius such that the total surface is preserved.

Figure \ref{fig:Compare-Comsol} shows the difference between the results from
the equation (full line) and a finite element method calculation using Comsol
(dots) for a nanorod of length $50\nm$ and diameter $21\nm$. The cross section
and dissipated power was kept the same. The blue circles are the results given
by using the built-in material properties of water, i.e. a thermal conductivity
that depends on temperature. The diamonds are the results when the thermal
conductivity is fixed to $0.61 \W(\m\K)^{-1}$. The difference is accentuated at
higher temperatures.
