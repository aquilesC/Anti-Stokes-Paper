\title{Gold nanoparticles as nano-thermometers}

\keywords{Gold nanorods, Plasmon, Anti-Stokes, Sensing, Temperature}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Nano-thermometry is a challenging field that can open the door
to very intriguing questions ranging from biology and medicine to material sciences.
Gold nanorods are excellent candidates to act as nanoprobes because they are
reasonably bright emitters upon excitation with a monochromatic source.
Moreover gold nanoparticles are already used in photothermal therapy as efficient
transducers of electromagnetic radiation into heat. In this work we show that
the spectrum of the anti-Stokes emission from gold nanorods irradiated in
resonance can be used to measure the absolute temperature of the nanoparticles.
The procedure does not require any previous calibration and can be easily
implemented in any microscope capable of acquiring emission spectra. We show
that the luminescence spectrum of single gold nanorods closely follows
Bose-Einstein statistics. We model the emission considering interactions of the
electrons and holes created upon absorption of a photon with thermal excitations
in the metal, in particular phonons.

\section{Introduction}
Most physical, chemical and biological processes depend on
temperature. Together with the miniaturization of devices and the advent of
nanotechnology the need for measuring temperature with high spatial accuracy
started to emerge. Notably in biology\cite{Yang2011a,Hrelescu2010} and
medicine\cite{Li2013c} measuring and controlling temperature at a single cell
level will provide not only insight into intracellular processes but it will
also contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in proposed
new therapies such as photothermal tumor ablation\cite{Gobin2007} or controlled
drug delivery\cite{Huang2006,Huo2014}.

Probes with distinctive spectral features are ideal candidates for temperature
measurements since they provide high spatial accuracy while far-field optics
allow a non-contact readout. Some of the proposed strategies include structures
that undergo a conformational change upon an increase in
temperature\cite{Ebrahimi2014}, thus inducing variations in fluorescence
intensity of a dye molecule embedded into them. Also cleverly designed
fluorescent probes\cite{Vetrone2010} in which the ratio of particular emission
peaks depends on temperature allow a high accuracy and can be used for
intracellular thermometry.

The use of anti-Stokes fluorescence emission from lanthanide ions has been
studied for several years\cite{Auzel2004a} and can be used to determine
temperature with high accuracy. However organic dyes show a very low amount of
emitted photons with a higher energy than the excitation energy, rendering their
use in biological conditions very challenging. Recently Surface Enhanced Raman
Spectroscopy (SERS) allowed to measure spectral changes induced by temperature
down to single molecules\cite{Pozzi2015}, but a careful calibration of the
measurements is crucial.

At a cellular level measuring temperature has been subject to extensive
debate\cite{Yang2011a,Suzuki2015}. Many cellular processes may be subject to
temperature variations, including heat generation at mitochondria. However the
measured temperature changes\cite{Yang2011a} are in the order of $10^5$ times
higher than the expected values drawn from theoretical models\cite{Sato2014}.
Moreover new applications in photothermal therapy require locally increasing the
temperature in order to induce the death of specific cells in a
tissue\cite{Huang2008,Huang2006}. Many of these methods employ metallic
nanoparticles as heat sources\cite{Gobin2007,Hirsch2003} but rely on
models\cite{Zhao2014a} or on ad-hoc calibrations to estimate the temperatures
reached\cite{Donner2013}. Therefore a method that allows both to increase the
local temperature and to monitor it will be of great interest in a broad range
of fields.

Gold nanoparticles continue to receive a fair amount of attention because of
their unique optical properties\cite{Zijlstra2011}. The collective oscillation
of conduction electrons, also known as plasmon, shows a resonance in the visible to
near infra-red wavelengths. This resonance can be tuned by changing the shape of
the particles\cite{Carattino2016} and will be responsible for a large absorption
and scattering cross section at the resonance wavelength. It is therefore simple
to detect nanoparticles in a dark field scattering\cite{Hu2008} configuration or
via photothermal imaging\cite{Berciaud2006}. Detecting the particles through
their luminescence\cite{Tcherniak2011} is also possible; their low quantum
yield\cite{Fang2012,Rao2015,Yorulmaz2012,Cheng2015}, in the order of $10^{-5}$
is compensated by the enhanced cross section. Moreover the luminescence signal
is stable over time; gold nanoparticles do not blink nor bleach, therefore
they are useful labelling agents for processes that require extended periods of
observation\cite{Wang2005}.

Different metallic nano-objects are being introduced as agents for photothermal
therapy or drug delivery\cite{Kang2013,Huang2006,Huang2008}. One of the
advantages of gold nanoparticles is the possibility of tuning their resonance to
the near infra-red range, where the penetration of light into tissues can be of
several
centimeters\cite{Huang2006,Gobin2007,Hirsch2003,ONeal2004,Li2013c,Huang2008}.
Moreover the particles can be used not only for treatment, but also for
imaging\cite{Zhao2014a,Huang2006}. In this work we propose that the anti-Stokes
luminescence of gold nanorods and nanospheres can be used to measure their
temperature with relatively high accuracy.

Luminescence of metallic nanoparticles has been the object of extensive study in
recent years. Since the first observation of luminescence from bulk
gold\cite{Mooradian1969}, different groups have tried to quantitatively describe
the observed properties\cite{Mohamed2000,Beversluis2003a}, such as the quantum
yield\cite{Fang2012,Rao2015,Yorulmaz2012,Cheng2015,Dulkeith2004} and the
emission spectrum\cite{Link2010}. The cross section of different geometries can
be calculated employing different computer
packages\cite{Yurkin2011,Draine1994,Oskooi2010}, obtaining a vary good agreement
between calculations and what is experimentally achievable.

Luminescence from single gold nanoparticles can be observed when
irradiating them with a monochromatic source. Gold nanorods present two distinct
resonance energies, namely the transverse and the longitudinal plasmon
resonance. These particles can therefore be excited efficiently at one of those
energies; the transverse resonance corresponds to a wavelength of $532\nm$ and will give
rise to a broad emission with a peak at the longitudinal plasmon energy.
Conversely it is possible to excite the particles with a wavelength matching
the longitudinal plasmon resonance. In this case the excitation benefits from
an enhanced absorption cross section, but the emission that overlaps the plasmon
resonance will be mostly blocked by the filters needed to prevent direct
excitation light from reaching the detectors.

In this work luminescence refers to the emission from nanoparticles observed at
energies different from the excitation energy. Normally it is expected that
after absorption of a photon, the electrons in the particle will relax and the
emitted photon will appear at lower energies than the excitation. If this is the
case, the emission is called Stokes-shifted; however gold nanoparticles when
excited in resonance also present a significant emission at higher energies
called anti-Stokes emission\cite{He2015,Jiang2013,Carattino2016a}.

The mechanism we propose to explain the luminescence from gold nanoparticles is
based on the radiative recombination of electrons and holes that are created
upon the absorption of an incident photon\cite{Dulkeith2004,Mooradian1969}. The
emission will be enhanced by the presence of the surface plasmon acting as an
antenna\cite{Mohamed2000}. At the same time, the probability of the interaction
of the electron or hole with a thermal bath (a phonon or a carrier) before
recombining can give rise to an emitted photon with a higher energy than the
excitation photon's\cite{Hodak2000,Giri2015,Arbouet2003a}.

A monochromatic photon with energy $\hbar\omega_\textrm{L}$ incident on the
particle will give rise to a collective oscillation of the gas of conduction
electrons called plasmon. The lifetime of the oscillation can be measured in
pulsed experiments or calculated from the inverse of the linewidth and is in the
order of $10\fs$\cite{Sonnichsen2002}. The plasmon decays by forming a pair of
hot electron and hole with an internal energy equal to the plasmon
energy\cite{Sundararaman2014,Brongersma2015,AlejandroManjavacasJunG.LiuVikramKulkarni2014}.

The hot electron and hole cool down by exchanging energy with the lattice on a
timescale of $\tau\approx1\ps$\cite{Pustovalov2005}. Before this happens,
electron and hole have a small probability of recombining radiatively, i.e. of 
re-emitting their high electronic energy as a photoluminescence photon. If they
have interacted only with static surfaces, their energy will be the same and
therefore the emitted photon will have the same energy as the incoming
photon, and will not contribute to the measured photoluminescence (as it will be
blocked by the notch filter.) If, on the other hand, they have interacted with a
phonon or a thermally excited electron or hole, they may have lost or acquired
energy before recombining.

Electron and hole can interact with baths upon recombination, either by
creation or annihilaton of a phonon. In both cases the energy available upon
recombination cannot much exceed $\hbar\omega_L+k_BT$. It has to be noted that
in the hypothesis of a single-photon absorption at low excitation power, the
temperature $T$ is that of the baths before absorption, i.e. the temperature of
the medium surrounding the particle. This is different from pulsed experiments,
in which the electron gas temperature can be orders of magnitude higher than
room temperature\cite{Baffou2013a}. 

Radiative recombination gives rise to weakly emitting sources spectrally and
spatially distributed throughout the particle over a broad frequency band with
an exponential cutoff at $\hbar\omega_\textrm{L}+k_\textrm{B}T$. The weak
recombination emission can be greatly enhanced by the surface plasmon resonance,
acting as an antenna. With this model the following predictions can be made.
Firstly the emission spectrum must follow the plasmon spectrum if the excitation
laser is well above the plasmon resonance as shown in \mbox{Figure
\ref{fig:spectra_intensity}} in the results. If the excitation falls within the
plasmon resonance, the spectrum is expected to follow the plasmon spectrum
multiplied by a Bose-Einstein statistics factor arising from phonon population.
This factor should be proportional to $\bar{n}$ for anti-Stokes and $\bar{n}+1$
for Stokes processes, where

\begin{equation}
	\bar{n}=\left(\exp\frac{\hbar\omega}{k_BT}-1\right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}

With this model, it can also be predicted that the emission should be polarized;
for the longitudinal plasmon of gold nanorods this polarization coincides with
the longitudinal axis of the particle\cite{He2015}. Moreover, the lifetime
should be determined by the lifetime of hot electrons and holes and should be
significantly shorter than the thermalization time of the carriers. If this was
not the case, some interactions would be enough to reduce the carriers' energy
and therefore the electron and hole wouldn't have enough energy to produce an
optical photon. Finally, only the presence of hot carriers is required in the
model. As the wavevectors are randomly distributed at all times, the
recombination probability remains constant at all stages of relaxation.
Therefore excitation well above the plasmon resonance should excite the
photoluminescence with nearly the same efficiency as just above the plasmon
resonance\cite{Cheng2015}. Differences in the distribution of electrons and
holes appear if the excitation energy allows interband
transitions\cite{Sundararaman2014,Brown2016}. 

In this work we propose to use the anti-Stokes luminescence emission from gold
nanoparticles to determine their temperature. According to the model just
described, the anti-Stokes emission follows the following form,

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fitting}
	I(\omega) =
	\textrm{I}_{\textrm{SPR}}(\omega)\cdot\left(\exp\frac{\hbar(\omega-\omega_\textrm{L})}{k_\textrm{B}T}-1\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $I$ is the intensity, $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the
photons, $\omega_\textrm{L}$ is the frequency of the laser, $\hbar$ is Planck's
constant, $k_\textrm{B}$ the Boltzmann constant. $\textrm{I}_{\textrm{SPR}}$ is
the surface plasmon resonance that can be obtained by exciting the particle at
energies higher than the resonance or, ideally, by looking at the scattering
spectrum. Even if these two spectra are not identical, they overlap in the range
of wavelengths comprising the maximum of the emission and
longer\cite{Yorulmaz2012}; in the results section a lengthier discussion will be
given. The only remaining free parameter is the temperature $T$ (plus a
normalization constant not included in eqn.
\ref{eqn:fitting}.) This means that carefully fitting the emission spectra
excited at two frequencies ($\nu\gg\nu_{\textrm{SPR}}$ and
$\nu\approx\nu_{\textrm{SPR}}$) allows us to extract the absolute temperature of
the particles without any previous calibration.


\section{Experimental method}
All the measurements in this work were performed with a home-built confocal
microscope equipped with an APD and a spectrometer (Acton 500i). Samples were
mounted in a flow cell that allowed us to increase the temperature of the medium
up to $60\,^oC$ and to monitor it through a Pt100 resistance thermometer placed
$1\mm$ away from the observation area.

Samples were prepared by spin casting a suspension of nanoparticles onto clean
coverslips. Nanorods with average dimensions of $21\nm\times50\nm$ and a plasmon
resonance around $650\nm$ were synthesized following the seeded-growth
method\cite{Nikoobakht2003}. We employed a $532\nm$ (CNI) laser for
characterizing the nanorods' plasmon and a $633\nm$ HeNe (Thorlabs) was employed
to excite the nanorods in resonance.

Room temperature measurements were performed using a $60X$, NA $1.4$ oil
immersion objective (Olympus). This provided high excitation and collection
efficiency. At higher temperatures an air-spaced objective, $60X$, NA $0.9$
(Olympus) was employed to avoid the presence of a heat sink directly in contact
to the observed area. With this objective both the excitation and collection
efficiencies are significantly lower. The lower excitation efficiency can be
compensated increasing the excitation power, the lower collection however is
inherent to the method and can be compensated only by increasing the exposure
time.

To compensate for the drift of the setup while increasing the temperature, we
developed a computer program to continuously track a reference particle. The
same program was responsible for recording the temperature and triggering the
spectrometer. In this way complete data sets were acquired at different
temperatures, including spectra while exciting at $532\nm$, at $633\nm$ with
different laser intensities and the temperature measured by the Pt100. A
spectrum with $532\nm$ laser excitation was taken after every cycle to ensure
that the particle under study was not reshaping due to higher excitation powers.

The intensity of the lasers was controlled via the voltage applied to an AOM in
the optical path. Several accumulations of the spectra at the same laser
intensity were recorded. This not only allowed us to lower the noise of the
measurements because of a longer exposure time, but also allowed us to remove
bright pixels generated by cosmic rays. Having several accumulations is also
useful to monitor changes in the intensity of the spectra during the acquisition
itself. These changes can be due to a drift of the setup while measuring or to a
reshaping of the particle. If the reshaping was confirmed by comparing the
spectra acquired with the $532\nm$ laser\cite{Liu2009}, the measurements where
rejected. If the changes in the observed emission spectra were due to drift of
the setup, the particular data set was not taken into account. For the purposes
of this work the excitation intensity is crucial for characterizing the method;
if the particle is not in focus it would result in an over estimation of the
excitation power.


\section{Results}

\caption{Luminescence spectra of a single gold nanorod. The green curve is the
emission under $532\nm$ excitation. In red is the fitting by a lorentzian; the
dashed part is the region that was not considered for the fitting. The other
curves are the emission of the same particle under $633\nm$ irradiation at three 
different powers. The inset shows the anti-Stokes-to-Stokes ratio as a function
of the excitation power, overlapped with a linear fit in red.}
	\label{fig:spectra_intensity}
\end{figure}

The proposed model for the anti-Stokes emission requires to know the plasmon
spectrum ($\textrm{I}_{\textrm{SPR}}$ function in equation \ref{eqn:fitting}) of
the particle in order to fit the emission at shorter wavelengths and extract the
particle temperature. It has been shown that both scattering and luminescence
spectra roughly overlap over a broad range of wavelengths\cite{Yorulmaz2012}. Therefore
exciting gold nanorods with $532\nm$ allows us to record the longitudinal
plasmon spectra, as shown in the green solid curve of Figure \ref{fig:spectra_intensity}. The
peak was fitted by a single lorentzian, shown in red in the Figure; the dashed
part of the curve is the spectral region that was not considered for the
fitting. It has to be recalled that the luminescence spectrum is not a perfect
lorentzian since there is a broadband contribution to the luminescence arising
between the excitation wavelength and the plasmon peak\cite{Boyd1986}. This
appears as an asymmetry in the emission spectrum, particularly visible for
wavelengths smaller than $625\nm$. The results of this fitting will be employed
for the $I_\textrm{SPR}$ function defined in equation \ref{eqn:fitting}. 

The other curves in Fig. \ref{fig:spectra_intensity} show the luminescence emission of
the same nanorod while irradiating with a $633\nm$ laser at different powers,
ranging from $25\uW$ to $75\uW$ at the back aperture of the objective. The
vertical black line shows the wavelength of the laser. The Stokes part of the
spectrum at longer wavelengths than the excitation shows the same shape as the
plasmon emission observed under $532\nm$ excitation, apart from a normalization
factor. From the figure it can readily be seen that the shape of the anti-Stokes
emission, at shorter wavelengths than excitation, is exponential-like and
doesn't follow the lorentzian shape of the Stokes emission. The dip between
Stokes and anti-Stokes is caused by the notch filter that prevents direct
excitation light from reaching the detectors.

The inset of Fig. \ref{fig:spectra_intensity} shows the anti-Stokes-to-Stokes ratio of
the integrated luminescence for different laser excitation intensities. It is
possible to see that even with a linear behavior, the anti-Stokes intensity
increases more rapidly with laser excitation power than the Stokes emission.
We already exploited this phenomenon to image gold nanorods in high-background
conditions\cite{Carattino2016a}. Moreover it shows that the anti-Stokes emission
depends on laser excitation power differently than its Stokes counterpart. 

\begin{figure}[tp] \centering

\caption{Ratio of the anti-Stokes to Stokes emission under $633\nm$ excitation
as function of the resonance wavelength of each particle.
The blue circles are experimental results, while the red triangles are the
results of the calculations with equation \ref{eqn:antiStokes}. There is a very
good agreement between experiment and calculations. Particles with a resonance
to the blue of the laser (vertical red line) have an increased anti-Stokes
emission.}
	\label{fig:ASS-ratio}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ASS-ratio} shows the ratio of the anti-Stokes to Stokes emission
for $90$ nanorods with different plasmon resonances and under the same $633\nm$
excitation; the blue circles are experimental data. The horizontal axis of the
figure is the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of each particle. The vertical red
line marks the laser wavelength. The particles shown in the plot had resonances
between $600\nm$ and $690\nm$; the ones showing the maximum ratio of anti-Stokes
to Stokes are those with a resonance to the blue of the laser. For these
particles the plasmon is enhancing preferably the anti-Stokes emission. For
particles with a resonance at the laser wavelength the anti-Stokes and the
Stokes emission have similar enhancement and show a ratio close to $10\%$. 

Figure \ref{fig:ASS-ratio} also shows the results of calculations as the red
triangles. A very good overlap between the measured and the calculated data can
be observed. The absorption cross section of several particles was calculated
with the ADDA package\cite{Yurkin2011}. Each calculated absorption spectrum was
fitted by a lorentzian and used as $\textrm{I}_{\textrm{SPR}}(\omega)$ in eqn.
\ref{eqn:fitting}. Assuming a diffraction limited laser spot and using the
calculated absorption cross section allowed us to calculate the temperature of
the particle. This value was used in eqn. \ref{eqn:fitting} to compute the
anti-Stokes emission spectrum. The Stokes emission was set proportional to the
excitation power and to a spectrum overlapping the absorption. Since both
anti-Stokes and Stokes emissions are proportional to the excitation power, this
term cancels out when computing the ratio. The laser power therefore only enters
into the equation when calculating the temperature of the particles. It is
remarkable that the agreement between data and calculations was achieved
without free parameters; solely taking into account the transmission spectra of
the filters.

\begin{figure}[tp] \centering
\includegraphics[width=78.4mm]{Figures/03_Fit_Of_AS/03_Log_Fit_AS.png}
\caption{Anti-Stokes emission at different irradiation powers with the
corresponding fits by equation \ref{eqn:fitting}. There is an excellent
agreement between data and model. The inset shows the extracted
temperature at each power (blue dots) and a linear extrapolation of the data to $0\uW$ excitation power.
The value obtained for room temperature was $293\K$ while the measured value was
$296\K$.}
	\label{fig:AS_in_Log}
\end{figure}

By fitting the anti-Stokes part of the spectra shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:spectra_intensity} with equation \ref{eqn:fitting} it is possible to extract
the temperature of the particle at each excitation power. Figure
\ref{fig:AS_in_Log} shows the results of this procedure. The spectra shown were
recorded at $4$ different excitation intensities while the full lines are the
fits; there is an excellent agreement between data and model. For every
anti-Stokes measurement we have also acquired the full plasmon spectrum while
exciting with a $532\nm$ laser before and after the temperature extraction.
The full plasmon spectrum is necessary to calculate the parameters of
$I_\textrm{SPR}$ from equation \ref{eqn:fitting} and also to verify that the
particle didn't reshape while being excited at resonance. 

The inset in fig. \ref{fig:AS_in_Log} shows the temperatures resulting from the
fits at different irradiation intensities (blue dots). It is remarkable that the
absolute temperatures of the particle were extracted without any previous
calibration. As expected, the temperature of the nanorod is proportional to the
excitation intensity, or equivalently to the absorbed energy. From these data it
is also possible to calculate the temperature at $0\uW$ excitation power, i.e.
room temperature, by extrapolating the results of a linear fit. The value we
obtained in this case is $293\pm 6 \K$, while room temperature was $296\K$, a
$2\%$ accuracy.

The accuracy of the obtained temperature depends to a great extent on the
plasmon resonance. The first step in the fitting procedure is the determination
of the term $I_\textrm{SPR}$ in equation \ref{eqn:fitting}. This is achieved by
fitting a lorentzian to the emission spectrum obtained while irradiating with a
$532\nm$ laser. In figure \ref{fig:spectra_intensity} it is possible to observe
that the emission spectrum is not perfectly lorentzian and therefore the fitting
results will be sensitive to the portion of the spectrum selected. Depending on
the wavelength range selected, the parameters of the lorentzian fit (its width
and peak position) can slightly change therefore giving rise to different
temperatures when fitting the anti-Stokes emission spectrum.

Equation \ref{eqn:fitting} shows that if the particle plasmon resonance is red
shifted with respect to the $633\nm$ laser, the term $I_\textrm{SPR}$ will have
a smaller effect on the temperature extracted. When the resonance is to the red
of the laser, the term $I_\textrm{SPR}$ will slowly vary in the region where the
anti-Stokes emission is observed. Therefore small changes in the parameters of
the lorentzian fit will have a small effect on the temperature extracted.
However, particles that are not in resonance with the excitation laser will
present a lower emission due to a smaller absorption cross section and to a
lower enhancement of the anti-Stokes emission (see for example figure
\ref{fig:ASS-ratio}). A balance between the amount of collected light and the
uncertainty produced by the correct determination of the plasmon resonance has
to be reached depending on each application. The error bar in figure
\ref{fig:AS_in_Log} and in the following figures is the result of the estimation
of the temperature uncertainty because of variations in the plasmon resonance
fit.

As expected from the model, the anti-Stokes emission should depend not only on
the particle's intrinsic properties but also on the temperature of the
surrounding medium\cite{Konrad2013}. The samples were therefore mounted in a
flow cell that allowed us to change the temperature and to measure it with a
Pt100 resistance thermometer. In this set of experiments we employed a dry
objective and therefore the laser powers are higher to compensate for the lower
excitation efficiency. At each temperature several spectra were acquired at
different $633\nm$ excitation powers and also a spectrum of the plasmon before
and after each measurement in order to monitor any possible reshaping of the
particles during the experiment.

\begin{figure}[tp] \centering
\includegraphics[width=88.4mm]{Figures/03_Fit_Of_AS/03_Log_Fit_AS_02.png}
\caption{Extracted temperatures at different excitation powers and at
different flow cell temperatures. The full lines are the results of the
calculated temperatures. The inset shows the extrapolated temperature at zero
excitation power.}
	\label{fig:AS_temp}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:AS_temp} shows the extracted temperature of a particle at
varying excitation powers and at different water temperatures. The blue circles
are the results of the measurement at $20\degree$, while the green crosses are
at $40\degree$ and the yellow squares at $60\degree$. The full lines are the
calculated temperatures for a particle with plasmon overlapping the measured one
and assuming a diffraction-limited focus spot. For the dimensions of the
particle, the mean values from TEM images were used and the length was adjusted
to obtain the same resonance. There is a remarkable agreement between the
calculation and the measured values. Moreover it is possible to extrapolate the
temperature at zero excitation power for each case as was explained earlier. The
results are shown in the inset of the figure for each temperature. The red line
with slope $1$ is a guide to the eye.

Figure \ref{fig:AS_temp} clearly shows that the extracted temperature varies
with the temperature of the surrounding medium. More strikingly the method does
not require any previous calibration nor adjustment. The values obtained with
the extrapolation to $0\uW$ excitation power were $299 \pm 8\K$, $311\pm 3\K$
and $347 \pm 6\K$ for water temperatures of $293\K$, $313\K$ and $333\K$
respectively. The calibration-free procedure would allow us to perform the same
measurements in any other setup and could act as a reference for calibration of
other nano thermometers.

\section{Conclusions}
Being able to control and monitor temperature at the nanoscale is of utmost
importance in different fields ranging from photothermal therapy\cite{Huang2006}
to nano fabrication\cite{Fedoruk2013}. In this work we have shown a simple
procedure that allows us to measure the temperature of single gold nanorods
irradiated under a monochromatic continuous laser and without any previous
calibration. The level of accuracy of the temperature measurement depends on
several factors, but for nanorods it can be estimated to be better than $6\K$.

The model employed for describing the anti-Stokes emission takes into account
the plasmon, responsible for enhancing the emission, as well as Bose-Einstein
statistics to explain the distribution of the excited states of the particles.
It has been shown that the correct characterization of the plasmonic resonance is
fundamental for the proper extraction of temperature, specially in cases
where the resonance is to the blue of the excitation wavelength.

Particles with a resonance to the red of the excitation wavelength would be more
reliable in the temperature extraction procedure, but would also exhibit a lower
emission towards shorter wavelengths. The trade-off between both effects and
the possibility to fully characterize the plasmon resonance, will determine the
specific particles that are better suited for each application.

A possible improvement would be the use of nanospheres. Since these particles do
not reshape under higher excitation powers it is possible to compensate their
lower cross section by increasing the irradiation intensity. However, their
quantum yield is at least one order of magnitude smaller than that of rods,
giving an overall lower photoluminescence intensity. Samples with a narrow shape
distribution such as bipyramids\cite{Pelton2009}  would be ideal candidates to
temperature extraction since their plasmon can be measured or determined from
theory, avoiding the need of a second excitation source.

% We have observed the anti-Stokes emission from particles with three different
% diameters. It was already possible to see that the heterogeneity in the shape of
% the particles induces plasmon resonances different from the ones predicted from
% Mie theory. The variation in the temperature extracted from the anti-Stokes
% spectra while increasing the medium's temperature falls within the experimental
% error. The obtained temperatures however are much higher than predicted from the
% heat equation. The samples normally have a distribution of sizes and shapes,
% assuming a perfectly spherical particle leads to an incorrect determination of
% the plasmon resonance that propagates into the determination of the surface
% temperature. 

The proposed method doesn't require any calibration, since the only free
parameter of the model is the absolute temperature of the nanoparticle under
study. Moreover the recording of the anti-Stokes spectrum is readily achievable
in any confocal microscope with a coupled spectrometer. A $6\K$ accuracy may
suffice for several applications; it is important to point out that this value
can be improved in different ways: by carefully selecting the particles that
show the most favorable plasmon resonance; by determining the plasmon resonance
through white-light scattering, avoiding the uncertainty in the fit; by
increasing the exposure times to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.
